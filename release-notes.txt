Version 3.5
=============

Version 3.5 intoduces a new Color Fill Style "New 4 : Color per Face". To use this style
first create a palette of colors using the control panel menu, then left-click select a color from the palette.
Now go to the image view and left-click on each face in turn to color it. A right-click will remove the color.

Additionally there are many bugfixes and improvements to support the workflow of creating mosaics.

Version 3.0
===========

Version 3.0 provides an improved stable platform for creating Mosaic designs.  There have been many code changes
since version 2.7. The image tools have been improved for creatig images and comparing differences.

Version 3.0 has been built with Qt 6.5.0 and Qt 5.15.2. It supports both cmake and qmake.

The media directory tree has been revised and versioning of files redone.  The intent has been to fully 
support the original taprats designs and make additions to that.  In doing so, it became apprarent that the
original taprats java designs used the class "ExplicitFigure".  This class was to produce motifs (figures)
for tiles (features) which were irregular polygons.  The ExplicitFigure class could be constructed in a number
of ways, but its data was persisted (saved) as a map which did not have any indication of how it was made. 
So for version 3.0, the TPM application was used to re-create the original map using the various supported
ways of creating the motif map.  This painstaking process has been largely successful, but there are a few
instances where the ExpicitFigure could not be recreated. The inference is that the design was created with
taprats code that differed from that which has been released/distributed and the exact way the design was
created is now lost. Since the development of taprats was exprimental and part of work done for Dr. Kaplan's
PhD thesis, it is quite understandable that his work on rosettes and stars changed over time as his expertise
and insights developed.  Nervertheless, the following mosaics still have some motifs built
with explicit maps (now using the ExplicitMapMotif class).
- Bloom of May
- Bluer shade of Sky
- Penrose Dots
- Rock the Hive
- Squoctagon
- USA

If an Inferred Motif is not in contact with another Inferred Motif then the app works well. For those other
cases a two-pass process on loading seems to work best.  Looking at the imported taprats code it is surmised
that the Infer class was created first, and the more specialised ways of creating Hourglass, Girih, etc., were
derived from that to handle the difficulties associated with multiple inffered motifs. However this is purely
speculation.  Islamic designs do have these shapes in contact, it is just this software that has difficulties
with this.

There are still placess where the IrregularMotifMap class (ex Explicitfigure) is used intentionally,
where maps are created (or modified) using the Map Editor.


Version 2.7
===========

Version 2.7 is a stabilization release with many bug fixes.  The overall workflow
from creating tilings to adding motifs which are decorated to make mosaics is working well.

In this version the terminology is streamlined under the hood to match the visible control
panel menus.
- Instead of tilings containing features, tilings now contain tiles
- Instead of prototypes containing figures (and features) they now contain motifs (and tiles)
- The resultaant mosaic decorates the prototype with styles

The original taprats/starpat embraced the concept of Polygons in Contact (PIC) and this remains the
central thrust of the program.  However, this constraint is relaxed in making tilings, so that tiles
can now be separated, and even overrlapped.  Articulation of these relaxed constraints is still a
work-in-progress.  But additionally tiles need not be repeated to flood the visible region. These
tilings are provisionally termed singletons.

Changes:
- Adds UNDO for Tiling Maker

Known Problems:
- The explicit/inferred rosette needs improvement. As it currently is it cannot reproduce all the
orignal taprats/starpat designs.


Version 2.6.0
=============

- Another round of menu improvements
- Improvements to crops and borders - but this is still really just a placeholder for
  implementation of more complex borders
- Map Editor improvements
        ○ Load/save of map in XML
        ○ Loading of tiling maps
        ○ Push from map to tiling

- Irregular features default to Explicit Feature rather then Infer
- Motifs displayed actual size or enlarged
- Multi-select of motifs support superposition of figures which can be made into a composite figure
- Maps merging improved support overlapping in tiles (this deviates from the concept of just using
  PICs (polygons in contact))
- Fill Region definition improvements

BugFixes:
- Style duplication
- Linux build repaired

Builds:
    Both cmake and qmake builds supported
    Qt versions 5.15.2 and 6.3.1 supported

  in keyboard controls
- Grid re-implemented as a map so points can be selected in tiling maker.
  Now has its own menu and view select

Bug Fixes:
- Major memory leak present from version 1.1 fixed

  mosaics which had the Fill Style. This code has now been optimized and loading speeds are similar to versions 2.1 and previous
