Version 2.7
===========

Version 2.7 is a stabilization release with many bug fixes.  The overall workflow
from creating tilings to adding motifs which are decorated to make mosaics is working well.

In this version the terminology is streamlined under the hood to match the visible control
panel menus.
- Instead of tilings containing features, tilings now contain tiles
- Instead of prototypes containing figures (and features) they now contain motifs (and tiles)
- The resultaant mosaic decorates the prototype with styles

The original taprats/starpat embraced the concept of Polygons in Contact (PIC) and this remains the
central thrust of the program.  However, this constraint is relaxed in making tilings, so that tiles
can now be separated, and even overrlapped.  Articulation of these relaxed constraints is still a
work-in-progress.  But additionally tiles need not be repeated to flood the visible region. These
tilings are provisionally termed singletons.

Changes:
- Adds UNDO for Tiling Maker

Known Problems:
- The explicit/inferred rosette needs improvement. As it currently is it cannot reproduce all the
orignal taprats/starpat designs.


Version 2.6.0
=============

- Another round of menu improvements
- Improvements to crops and borders - but this is still really just a placeholder for
  implementation of more complex borders
- Map Editor improvements
        ○ Load/save of map in XML
        ○ Loading of tiling maps
        ○ Push from map to tiling
        ○ Loading from motif (single or multiple)
        ○ Switch between map and DCEL for prototypes
        ○ Introduces layers and composites
- Use of worklists for loading, generating and comparing images
- Adds multi-view
- Irregular features default to Explicit Feature rather then Infer
- Motifs displayed actual size or enlarged
- Multi-select of motifs support superposition of figures which can be made into a composite figure
- Maps merging improved support overlapping in tiles (this deviates from the concept of just using
  PICs (polygons in contact))
- Fill Region definition improvements

BugFixes:
- Style duplication
- Linux build repaired

Builds:
    Both cmake and qmake builds supported
    Qt versions 5.15.2 and 6.3.1 supported


Version 2.5.1
=============

Bug Fixes:
- transparency filter when loading images was not working
- background colors were not being set correctly
- Clear All moved to top line of control panel and improved
- Improved text in control panel top lines
- background images missing from system info

Version 2.5
===========

- Improved alignment and resizing of layers in view.
- Layers can be adjusted separately by selecting layer in 'Layer info' and selecting "Adjust Selected Layer"
  in keyboard controls
- Grid re-implemented as a map so points can be selected in tiling maker.
  Now has its own menu and view select
- Improvements to Backgrounds. Now has its own menu and view select
- Better way of setting centers

Bug Fixes:
- 'Scale to View' now working without any pops
- Filled style algorithm 2 modification were not immediately displayed

Version 2.4
===========

Changes:
- Adds integration of borders into Mosaic design
- Adds definition of borders from border menu using the map editor in prototype mode
- Borders functionality has been removed from the Model Settings menu tab and placed into its own new Borders tab.
- The Design Element View and its associated menu tab have been removed.
  The functionality has been added to the Prototype View and menu
- All views now have same default size making alignment of views better

Bug Fixes:
- Major memory leak present from version 1.1 fixed
- The introduction of using a DCEL (Doubly Connected Edge List) in version 2.2 substantially slowed down loading of
  mosaics which had the Fill Style. This code has now been optimized and loading speeds are similar to versions 2.1 and previous
- Reset of style representations did not completely reset Filled styles
- Changing colors for Interlaced and Emboss did not update immediately
- Map Editor: push to tiling fixed
- Map Editor: fixed crashes when no map loaded

Builds:
Now recommend building with Qt6. (Qt5.15 is still supported)

Version 2.3.1
=============

Changes:
- Tiling loader has modify/replace option
- Adds worklist operations save and edit to Image Tools (designer mode)
- Prototype View: adds highlighting
- Map editor: bugfix - now does not build maps unless required
- Image Tools: next and prev now close existing image windows
- Media: several versions of Test10 and Test11 deleted
- Face Set view removed, uses face selection instead

Bug fixes:
- Editing of filled style colors repaired
- Improved propagation of tiling changes into existing design
- Fill mode 2 was not selecting correctly
- Fixes non-responsiveness of Prototype View to tiling and motif changes

Version 2.3.0
=============

Contains numerous bug fixes and the following changes

Tiling Maker:
- Refactor of decorative class filled with options to cleanse the design
- Adds clear background image
- Improved loading and saving of background images
- Improved perspective adjustment (camera skew correction) for backgrounds
- Additional control of Repetition points using angle and length
- Fill is adjusted automatically as repetition points and repetition counts are changed
- Highlighting of spin boxes

Mosaics:
- Background image is independent of tiling Background Image

GUI:
- Highlighting of all spin boxes
- improves consistency of view sizes
- Improved resizing of mosaics
- default view sizes adjusted to better fit on 1920x1080 monitors
- adds interval timing/elapsed timing in logger (Insight Mode)

Designer Mode:
- Map Editor reloads map when tiling changes
- Map Editor removes unnecessary rebuild of Prototype by map editor
- Image Tools now a separate menu
- Simplification of media directory configuration

Source Code:
- This version is built using Qt Version 6.0.2

Version 2.2.0
==============

The emphasis of this release has been on smoothing out the workflow from creating tilings,
to applying motifs (figures) to tile features, to decorating the design to product a finished mosaic.

Version 2.1.0
=============

- New functions and increased usability.
- Many bugs fixed.

Version 1.8.1
=============

- Introduces 'Designer Mode' and 'Insight Mode".
- Major revision of control panel for usability improvements.

Version 1.7.1
=============

Menu usability improvements

Version 1.7.0
=============

- More user friendly menu system plus
- Cleanup of media files.
- More support for curved lines.
