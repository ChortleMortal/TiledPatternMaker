Version 4.1.1
=============

Fixes
    SystemView  Reverted 4.1 code which caused performance hit
    Map Editor  Fixed 4.1 code causing another performance hit

Version 4.1.1
=============

Fixes
    Rosette2    Uninitialised tip mode in 4.1 caused crash
    Rosette2    Duplicated rotation transform in 4.1 caused motif to be incorrect

Version 4.1
============

Improvements:

- Addition of Mosaic distortion to fit into spaces (via mosaic maker and the prototype info page)
- Additon of cropping Background Images
- Addition of a third tip type to the Rosette2 Style
- Improvements to Mosaic and Painter crops and their interaction with Border crops
- Addition of pressing 'b' and 'shift-b' for toggling view of background images
- Further clarification of keyboard shortcuts (use F1 to look at these in context)
- Major refactor of the Map Editor for 'pushes' back from the Map Editor to Mosaics,
  Motifs, and Tilings.

Fixes:
- Crops in the Crop Maker View were obscured by Borders
- Borders should have had Primary rather than Derived Layer positioning

Note:
    Mosaic design Alh1485.v6 illustrates both the use of the new third Rosette tip
    type and the use of Mosaic distortion.  Using b and shift-b shows the relation of the
    rendered Mosaic to a photo of the original in the Alhambra used as a Background Image


Version 4.0
===========

This is a significant new release with hundreds of modifications and changes.  Emphasis again has been on improving
the UI menu system to support the overall workflow from tiling creation and motif creation to applying styles to form
complete mosaics. Additionally, photographs of designs (pngs, jpgs) can be imported, adjusted for size, position,
and skew, so that tilings and completed mosaics can be built as layers on top of the background image, and so assist
in the analysis and re-creation of the imported design.

Core functionality has been enhanced to:
    - support creation and of curved lines
    - support overlapping tiles in tilings and compositing tiling layers (more than one tiling in a design), thus
      going further than the use of 'polygons in contact' described by Hankin
    - Support of 'lawful inexactitudes' by using the map editor to fit together regular polygons that don’t exactly
      align, so making them irregular polygons in the manner described by Hankin.
    - implementation of crops, together with a rudimentary implementation of borders for placing designs into
      a defined space.
    - The alignment of layers (views) has been improved. Each layer has a transform of translation, scale, and rotation,
      applied to it. Tilings, Mosaic Styles, and Background Image layers are considered primary and all other views are derived.
      In general layers are aligned to one primary layer the SYS transform.  However layers can break away from SYS and become
      independent (INDP).  When a layer is independent, keyboard/mouse positioning is not applied to independent layers.
      Also, a layer can be made SOLO, so that keyboard/mouse positioning is only applied to this layer. When SOLO is turned off
      it becomes independent.  Examples of use are having mosaic style layers be offset from one another, or a motif pattern
      be enlarged to work on it using the motif maker. Positioning can also be locked for any layer except the current primary.

Improvements:

    Motif Maker         Redesigned. Single mode shows an enlarged single motif.  Selected mode allows display
                        of all motifs in the Tiling Unit.  And (new) All mode shows all motifs in the
                        Prototype.  This is similar to Prototype View but with a different emphasis.
    Tiling Maker        Significant rework to support compositing tilings to make a mosaic and move
                        tiles between loaded tilings
                        Adds placement of tile into a corner (as per Hankin). Best used in
                        single(ton) mode
                        Supports loading more than one tiling. Each tiling has its own motifs which
                        can be superimposed on each other.
    Outline Style       Code refactored and fixes made to bad casing points.  Similarly to the issue
                        with map cleansing, it would be better to generate a good casing in the first
                        place rather than repair the generated casing.
    Interlace Style     Substantially improved to handle curves. But still a work in progress.
    Startup             Faster
    Control Panel       All control panel pages can now be floated.  Either double-click or right-click on
                        item in Menu Select to detach.  Similarly, menus which have tabs can have each tab floated
                        by double clicking in the tab. To re-attach, simply dismiss (close) the menu pop up.
    Layer Control       Emphasis on controlling the relationship between viewable layers such as mosaic layers of styles,
                        background images. Most layers are synchronized such that keyboard actions to position, scale,
                        or rotate are coordinated. This is especially important for background image layers.
                        However layers can now be locked (to avoid modification) or soloed such that keyboard actions
                        only modify that layer. These selections of independent, locked, soloed, are used throughout
                        the menu system. A new menu page 'Layer Control' is added which summarizes all the visible layers.
    Map Editor          Map line extensions have been revised, and F-key functions have been reorded. Some help
                        messages on panel status line have been added.
    File Services       The construction line template directory (used by the map editor) has been moved
                        from media/design/templates to media/templates and re-implemented as .xml files.
                        (Older template .dat files have been deleted and moved into .xml files)
    Tools

Fixes:
    Motif Maker         Numerous display and selection fixes
    Image Tools         View tilings cycler did not cycle
    Split Screen        Improved handling of floating menu pages in large screen mode
    Control Panel       Page status bar at top of panel was not always displayed
    Control Panel       Turning off multi-select turned off too many views

Build System            This release has been built and tested with Qt 6.10.1  Support for builds with Qt5 is no
                        longer supported.  Cmake builds have been enhanced to use Unity builds and optional caching.
Roadmap:
    Interlace Style     There is room for much improvement here, especially relating to wide lines. Also.
                        requires better integration with Borders and Crops
    Borders             Current implementation is rudimentary, more a placeholder for future designs.
    Map Editor          Push from map editor to tiles, tilings, motifs, and mosaics needs improvement.
                        It works now in some cases, but not for others.

Version 3.6.2
=============

Fixes:
    View                (Windows only) Resizing of View could cause crash

Fixes:
    Splash screen       Did not work on exit
    Exit                Logging too verbose

Version 3.6
=============

Improvements:
    Motifs              The way motifs are constructed has been refactored.
                        - Radial motifs are now based on rays which can be extended or connected
                        - Motifs can now be cleansed in the same way as complete Mosaics.
                          But this begs the unanswered question as to why they were not better
                          constructed in the first place, so they wouldn't require cleansing.

Version 3.0
===========

Version 3.0 provides an improved stable platform for creating Mosaic designs.  There have been many code changes
since version 2.7. The image tools have been improved for creating images and comparing differences.

Version 3.0 has been built with Qt 6.5.0 and Qt 5.15.2. It supports both cmake and qmake.

The media directory tree has been revised and versioning of files redone.  The intent has been to fully 
support the original taprats designs and make additions to that.  In doing so, it became apparent that the
original taprats java designs used the class "ExplicitFigure".  This class was to produce motifs (figures)
for tiles (features) which were irregular polygons.  The ExplicitFigure class could be constructed in a number
of ways, but its data was persisted (saved) as a map which did not have any indication of how it was made. 
So for version 3.0, the TPM application was used to re-create the original map using the various supported
ways of creating the motif map.  This painstaking process has been largely successful, but there are a few
instances where the ExpicitFigure could not be recreated. The inference is that the design was created with
taprats code that differed from that which has been released/distributed and the exact way the design was
created is now lost. Since the development of taprats was experimental and part of work done for Dr. Kaplan's
PhD thesis, it is quite understandable that his work on rosettes and stars changed over time as his expertise
and insights developed.  Nevertheless, the following mosaics still have some motifs built
with explicit maps (now using the ExplicitMapMotif class).
- Bloom of May
- Bluer shade of Sky
- Penrose Dots
- Rock the Hive
- Squoctagon
- USA

If an Inferred Motif is not in contact with another Inferred Motif then the app works well. For those other
cases a two-pass process on loading seems to work best.  Looking at the imported taprats code it is surmised
that the Infer class was created first, and the more specialized ways of creating Hourglass, Girih, etc., were
derived from that to handle the difficulties associated with multiple inferred motifs. However this is purely
speculation.  Islamic designs do have these shapes in contact, it is just this software that has difficulties
with this.

There are still places where the IrregularMotifMap class (ex Explicitfigure) is used intentionally,
where maps are created (or modified) using the Map Editor.


Version 2.7
===========

Version 2.7 is a stabilization release with many bug fixes.  The overall workflow
from creating tilings to adding motifs which are decorated to make mosaics is working well.

In this version the terminology is streamlined under the hood to match the visible control
panel menus.
- Instead of tilings containing features, tilings now contain tiles
- Instead of prototypes containing figures (and features) they now contain motifs (and tiles)
- The resultant mosaic decorates the prototype with styles

The original taprats/starpat embraced the concept of Polygons in Contact (PIC) and this remains the
central thrust of the program.  However, this constraint is relaxed in making tilings, so that tiles
can now be separated, and even overlapped.  Articulation of these relaxed constraints is still a
work-in-progress.  But additionally tiles need not be repeated to flood the visible region. These
tilings are provisionally termed singletons.

Changes:
- Adds UNDO for Tiling Maker

Known Problems:
- The explicit/inferred rosette needs improvement. As it currently is it cannot reproduce all the
original taprats/starpat designs.


Version 2.6.0
