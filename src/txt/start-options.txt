To start the application simply click on the icon on the desktop

The startup behavior can be modified by holding down keyboard keys as follows:

SHIFT     - Moves all windows to the primary screen and turns off auto-load
SHIFT/ALT - Resets configuration  to defaults.  This is very drastic  and 
            should only be done as a way of rescuing the application 
            if it fails to start normally 
 
 
Alternatively the application can be started from a console window by entering:
        .\TiledPatternMaker
 
When using the console window there are four additional optional parameters:
	.\TiledPatternMaker  --no-autoload  --map-verify  --load mosaicname --primary-display
 
--load name       : loads the  named mosaic (e.g. --load 12-6-trigon.v2 )
--no-autoload     : turns the auto-load configuration option off.
--map-verify      : turns the verify-map configuration option to on.
--primary-display : forces the control panel and the design viewer onto the primary display
--first-birthday  : resets all settings to defaults (drastic - use with care)
